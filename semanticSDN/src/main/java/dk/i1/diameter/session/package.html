Classes for implementing a session-capable Diameter client.
This package contains classes for implementing a Diameter node whose primary role is a client that holds diameter sessions, eg. a NAS, GGSN.
<p>
This is done by using two classes.
First, you instantiate a SessionManager. It takes care of the details about managing the node, sending and receiving messages (and lost connections), and timers in the sessions.
Second you will create a class that implements the Session interface. It is best to make this a subclass of BaseSession og AASession. You will probably want to mix in the ACHandler to support accounting.

<h2>Incomplete example</h2>
<pre>
Capability cap = ... //see {@link dk.i1.diameter.node.Capability}
NodeSettings settings = ... //see {@link dk.i1.diameter.node.NodeSettings}
Peer peers[]= {
    new Peer("somehost.example.net"),
    new Peer("someotherhost.example.net"),
};
SessionManager session_manager = new SessionManager(settings,peers);

BaseSession session = new ExampleSession(...);

session.openSession();
</pre>
