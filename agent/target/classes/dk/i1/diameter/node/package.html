<ol>
    <li>The first step in creating a Diameter Node is creating a set of capabilities. This is later on used for negotiating with peers. The capability set includes supported applications and vendor-IDs.</li>
    <li>The next step is creating a NodeSettings instance. A NodeSettings instance specifies the settings for your node including the capabilities, host-ID, etc.</li>
    <li>Then you are ready to create a Node, and NodeManager or SessionManager.</li>
